This study will explore how the Apple Watch® can work as a heart monitor for kids. As a part of the study, you will wear the Apple Watch for as long as 6 months, and any time you feel like your heart is beating fast or differently, you will record an ECG on the watch using the instructions below. Other than the fact that you are using an Apple Watch, there is no difference between being a part of the study and everything else about seeing your doctor.

Any time that you feel symptoms that feel like an arrhythmia (i.e., palpitations, skipped beats, fast heart rate):

1. First, press the event button on your Zio® Patch Monitor.
2. Second, initiate a recording on the Apple Watch by following these steps:
    • Open the ECG App.
    • Hold your finger to the Digital Crown for 30 seconds.
    • Follow the on-screen prompts on the Apple Watch.
